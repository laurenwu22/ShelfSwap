ShelfSwap is a web application designed for Tufts University students to
facilitate the swapping of used books within the community. It promotes
sustainability and community by allowing users to connect and exchange
books in a secure and user-friendly platform.

ðŸŒŸ Features

    - Search for books by title, author, or ISBN using the Google Books API.
    - Create and manage user profiles with Google OAuth authentication.
    - List available books for swapping and browse books posted by other users.
    - Connect with others in the Tufts community to initiate and complete book
    swaps.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack

    Frontend:
        - React: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
    
    Backend:
        - Node.js: Handles server-side operations.
        - Express: Simplifies the creation of routes and backend logic.
        - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and book data.

ðŸŽ¨ Design Process

    - Before development, I used Figma to create wireframes and high-fidelity
    prototypes. These designs were instrumental in visualizing the user journey
    and ensuring a user-friendly interface.

ðŸš§ Current Status

    - The backend is fully implemented, and I am finalizing the book swapping
    functionality by integrating the frontend with the backend routes.

ðŸ”œ Next Steps

    - Complete the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) by adding the final swapping
    features.
    - Launch a beta test with a select group of users for feedback and
    improvements.
    - Once the beta phase is complete, release ShelfSwap to the broader
    Tufts community.
